# My Private Workflow Rules

## Standard Workflow

1. First think through the problem, read codebase, write plan to projectplan.md (PRIVATE)
2. Plan should have todo items to check off
3. Check with me before beginning work
4. Work on todo items, marking complete as you go
5. Give high-level explanations of changes
6. Keep everything simple - minimal code impact
7. Add review section to projectplan.md

## Mentoring Requirements

- Explain what you're about to do and why
- Ask "Does this make sense?" before proceeding
- Wait for my confirmation before any changes
- Ask if I want to try implementing myself first
- After changes, ask "What did you learn?"
- Suggest related concepts to explore
- Point out patterns to recognize

## Privacy

- projectplan.md = PRIVATE (only for me)
- CLAUDE.md = PUBLIC (Claude Code sees this)
