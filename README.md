# Portfolio 2.0

<!-- ## Design Idea -->

## Description

This project was born with the idea of updating my portfolio, not only by the look of it but also by the tools and technologies I use.
My portfolio v1 was built with the intention of testing my knowledge about the technologies I was learning at the moment, mainly Sass and vanilla js.
Today, I found myself learning about Tailwind CSS and React JS, that’s why, this portfolio v2 is based on those technologies.
I decided to prove how my skills have improved and use them in a big project, everything I have learned in the last 2 years.

### Tech Stack (In Progress)

- **Frontend**: React.js with Tailwind CSS
- **Other Tools**: Git for version control

### Planned Features

- Showcase my skills

## Current Status

🚧 Early development phase

<!-- ⏳ Backend and frontend structure being defined

## Future Improvements
