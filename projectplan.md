## Mentoring Approach

Following the workflow rules:
1. **Explain First**: What we're about to do and why
2. **Ask Permission**: "Does this make sense?" before proceeding
3. **Wait for Confirmation**: Before making any changes
4. **Offer Learning**: "Do you want to try implementing this yourself first?"
5. **Reflect After**: "What did you learn from this?"
6. **Suggest Related**: Point out patterns and related concepts

## Review Section

### Current State Assessment: EXCELLENT
The codebase is professionally structured with modern React patterns, comprehensive internationalization, and performance optimizations. This is production-ready code that demonstrates strong development practices.

### Recommended Focus Areas:
